## **Ways of working**
First decision point - do you have **ANY** Domain Controllers within your environment? If so then you should install MDI **NOW** and make it the very top of your Security ToDo list.

Examples of **WHY** you do this first:

-   Small Customer in 2018, back when this was called "Azure ATP", installed only as a PoC and in under 48 hours it had identified a mis-configured Server that was exposed to the internet and was being brute-forced via RDP from Eastern Europe.
-   Larger environment 2020, client not sure but was wanting to lock down Legacy Auth, suggested that as they had E5 **strong recommendation** to deploy MDI ASAP across DC's. After getting CAB Approval to deploy, and with less than 10% coverage of DC's in just over a week it popped up with "NTDIS Exfil via SMB"
-   Security Value = **Priceless**

## **Enable Telemetry**

**Updated starting point:**
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/quick-installation-guide>
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/deploy-defender-identity>

Start here:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/prerequisites>
1.  Capacity planning
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/capacity-planning>
2.   Download the Sizing tool
<https://github.com/microsoft/ATA-AATP-Sizing-Tool/releases>
3.   Service account recommendations
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/directory-service-accounts>
4.   Download the Sensor
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/download-sensor>
5.   Install the Sensor on DC's
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/install-sensor>
6.   Basic Settings that you should review **NOW**
<https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWFVEX>

This will do for now, especially if you are in a crisis mode, check the console for the DC's being online - now move on to validation below.
Please follow up with all other Configuration steps as soon as practible, especially if you also have ADFS in play. 

**For ADFS** please also check - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/active-directory-federation-services>

## **Validate and Test**

Make sure you have the appropriate access to start with, if you have Admin rights to this tool you should see this once you have navigated to <https://security.microsoft.com> and selected > Settings > Identities > first step is to check the Sensors are deployed on **ALL** DC's
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/sensor-page.png#lightbox)

The most common error is "Directory Services Object Auditing is not configured as required" - this can be fixed by following instructions at: <https://aka.ms/mdi/objectauditing> 
![](./images/MDI_error.jpg)

Be conscious that if you are testing that MDI is working correctly that this may trigger **high impact** Alerts to your Blue Team or existing SecOps IF it's already installed and being monitored - or for that matter if another tooling is in place to monitor the same behaviour - so if doing some major testing it's worthwhile letting them know before hand?

And on that, make sure you schedule some time to review afterwards about what testing/alerting was created & what was visible from a SecOps perspective? 

!!! Warning
    If you are getting a Pen Test done at some stage - make sure the Pen Test activity does actually appear somewhere in your telemetry - it should, and if it doesn't then you don't actually have any coverage? MDI can and will do this for you

This would be valuable lessons on effectiveness - even more so if there is missing alerts?? :( 

-   Specific Validation information - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/configure-sensor-settings#validate-installations>
-   Make sure that Advanced Settings has Integration enabled - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/classic-integrate-mde>
-   Make doubly sure this Integration is enabled between ALL elements of MDI, MDE, MDO, MDCA and the M365 Defender Console
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/msde-enable.png)
-   Use Attack Simulations to **validate MDI is installed correctly** and Alerts are being surfaced accurately:
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbooks>
-   Use Labs for **in depth checking**: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-lab-overview>
-   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-domain-dominance>
-   Go to <https://portal.atp.azure.com> and if you see this, it's not been installed correctly

## **Enable Reporting**

Once enabled you should now have a lot more visibility into the Security Posture of the onPrem environment - including the following:

-    Domain controllers with Print Spooler service available
-    Dormant entities in sensitive groups
-    Entities exposing credentials in clear text
-    Microsoft LAPS usage
-    Legacy protocols usage
-    Riskiest lateral movement paths (LMP)
-    Unmonitored domain controllers
-    Unsecure account attributes
-    Unsecure domain configurations
-    Unsecure Kerberos delegation
-    Unsecure SID History attributes
-    Weak cipher usage

More details can be found here & example below - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment#assessment-reports>
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/select-assessment.png)

## **Review and Improve as needed**

-   Review Security Assessments to validate what potentially needs remediation: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment#assessment-reports>
-   Full list of the 44 Alerts that are being checked on your behalf when fully deployed: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/alerts-overview>
-   If you do not use the default Administrator account (ideally have it disabled?) then please add it to the Honeytoken account list: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/entity-tags#honeytoken-tags>
-   MDI (Hardened Environment) Setup from the Cyberlorians - <https://github.com/Cyberlorians/Articles/blob/main/MDI-Hardened.md>
-   Audit checking via Sentinel for MDI - <https://thalpius.com/2022/12/14/microsoft-defender-for-identity-auditing-checker-using-sentinel>
