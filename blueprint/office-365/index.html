<p>For each component within the document there is a brief description of the contents of the section, a commentary on the items that have been considered in determining the decisions and the design decisions themselves.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where data for any Microsoft service does not reside in Australia this has been explicitly called out.</li>
<li>Agencies can provide collateral for custom branding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="office-365-organisation">Office 365 Organisation</h2>
<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>
<p>Office 365 is a global service which is offered in many different physical regions. Choosing a region to store data is required to ensure that the data of the organisation does not get transferred or stored offshore.</p>
<p>Office 365 tenant residency is critical when setting up the organisation's Office 365 tenant. The region where the Office 365 tenant is set up determines where the data is store. Details of Office 365 data residency can be found from <a href="https://products.office.com/en-au/where-is-your-data-located">Microsoft's site</a>.</p>
<p>Office 365 tenant data residency consideration is required to ensure the organisation's Office 365 tenant is created and data is stored in Australia.</p>

<h3 id="licence">Licence</h3>
<p>Microsoft licences access to Office 365 and its security offerings through user-based licensing.</p>
<p>Microsoft offers several enterprise licencing options for Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS), and Windows.</p>
<p>These licencing options are summarised below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft 365 E5 (recommended for this blueprint). Microsoft 365 E5 includes everything inside Microsoft 365 E3 plus additional features and services (largely security and compliance related). In the case of Office 365 E5, the capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 suite as well as other services such as Office 365 Advanced Compliance are increased.</li>
<li>Microsoft 365 E3. Microsoft 365 E3 provides access to core products with enhanced features and security features. In the case of Office 365 E3, the Office client suite is included, and the service limits are increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>To grant access to the services a licence is assigned to an individual user account. A licence can be assigned by an administrator at the time of the user account is created or through Microsoft Entra ID group-based licensing. Microsoft Entra ID group-based licensing allows an Administrator to associate a licence to a group. Any members within the group will be assigned that licence automatically. When a user is removed from the group the licence is removed.</p>

<h3 id="self-service-purchase">Self service purchase</h3>
<p>Self-Service purchase add-ins for Office 365 allows users of Office 365 to purchase 3rd party add-ins to be added into Office 365 tenancy.</p>
<p>Self-service purchase of applications from the Microsoft Power Platform products was introduced in January 2020. By default, this is enabled for all users within the tenant and paid by credit card.</p>
<p>These processing of data for these add-ins does not sit within Office 365 tenancy. This might cause the data to flow outside and/or stored outside of Australia.</p>

<h3 id="office-365-services-and-add-ins">Office 365 services and add-ins</h3>
<p>Office 365 centrally manages Office services and add-ins. Office services and add-ins can enhance both the way information is accessed and the way business is conducted. Enabling Services and Add-ins also comes with risks, such as the risk of data being shared with other Microsoft services outside of the tenant boundary, or shared outside of Australian data centre locations. Out of the box, several services and add-ins are configured within the portal.</p>
<p>The design will take into consideration the services and add-ins that are part of Office 365. The design decision is based on the requirement provided by the organisation and application that is hosted on.</p>

<h3 id="role-based-access-control">Role based access control</h3>
<p>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) defines what a user or administrator has access to (data or user actions) based on the user's job function (role) within the organisation. In relation to system administration, RBAC provides various roles each of which can only perform certain tasks. For example, help desk staff may be able to only view certain resources, whereas system administrators could view, create, and delete those resources. Office 365 provides a subset of administrative roles available in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Privileged Identity Management (PIM) can be leveraged to enhance the RBAC model for Azure Active Directory role-based management access, and parts of other Microsoft services like Office 365 and Microsoft Endpoint Manager. PIM requests are made through the Azure portal for elevated access only when they are required, and access is expired after a specified period.</p>
<p>The following Office 365 roles can be assigned via PIM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange administrator.</li>
<li>Exchange recipient administrator.</li>
<li>SharePoint administrator.</li>
<li>Teams administrator.</li>
<li>Teams Communications administrator.</li>
<li>Teams Communications support engineer.</li>
<li>Teams Communications support specialist.</li>
<li>Power BI Administrator.</li>
<li>Power Platform administrator.</li>
<li>Customer Lockbox Administrator.</li>

<li>Office Apps administrator.</li>
<li>Message Center Privacy Reader.</li>
<li>Message Center Reader.</li>
<li>Security administrator.</li>
<li>Security reader.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, using PIM for the SharePoint administrator role, the Device administrator role, and roles trying to access the Microsoft Security and Compliance Center might experience delays of up to a few hours after activating the role, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-roles">PIM Roles</a> for further information.</p>

<h2 id="office-365-connectivity">Office 365 Connectivity</h2>
<p>Office 365 is a publicly facing SaaS offering and firewall ports are required to be opened to allow communication between infrastructure and desktops and Office 365. These ports configurations are updated frequently and are available online from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note the traffic between the clients and the Office 365 offering is TLS 1.2 encrypted.</p>
<p>Configuration will occur on the proxy and external gateway of the organisation as required.</p>
<p>Further details on the firewall configuration for the solution can be found in the Network Configuration ABAC.</p>
<h3 id="mail-flow-and-gateway">Mail flow and gateway</h3>
<p>Mail flow is the path taken by an email from the sender to a receiver. A Mail Gateway acts as the central egress and ingress point for mail traffic into an organisation.</p>
<p>For agencies implementing a PROTECTED environment, DTA recommends the use of a separate mail gateway to interface with <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/government/whole-government-information-and-communications-technology-services/govlink">GovLink</a> for the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption.</li>
<li>Message rules.</li>
<li>Header modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will achieve the closest alignment to whole of government policy for <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/gateway-hardening/gateway-security-guidance-package-gateway-security-principles">Secure Internet Gateways</a>, guidance of the <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-guidelines/guidelines-email">Information Security Manual</a> and the <a href="https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-11/policy-8-annex-g-email-protective-marking-standard.pdf">Protective Security Policy Framework</a>.</p>
<p>GovLink enables secure communication between Commonwealth entities across public infrastructure and is required for PROTECTED mail to be securely transferred between government organisations. When a GovLink mail gateway is required, Agencies can either use an existing gateway or a new gateway.</p>
<p>It is not possible to configure Exchange Online to directly send email via GovLink. Exchange Online must resolve to a public facing IP address, which is not possible across the GovLink network. In this instance a Mail Relay would be required with a public facing interface and a second interface that is able to connect to GovLink. </p>
<p>DTA is currently working with Microsoft and the Department of Finance to simplify an organisation's ability to achieve this, however at the time of writing there is no native solution to allow a direct interface between the Office365/Exchange Online environment and GovLink.</p>

<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>Office 365 is a globally distributed service. The user experience with Office 365 involves connectivity through highly distributed service connection points that are scaled over many Microsoft locations worldwide. This section outlines two sets of design decisions, representing advice to achieve the highest level of maturity and adherence to existing Whole of Government policies and advice to maximise optimisation outside and user experience. The below information is to inform agencies, including on how best to maximise optimisation and user experience, however consideration should be given for the risk implications of implementing in such a way. While this approach of optimisation represents the current <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/network-planning-and-performance?view=o365-worldwide">best practice published by Microsoft</a> it is inconsistent with the previously referenced guidance of the ISM and PSPF relating to Secure Internet Gateways. We have provided configuration controls for both scenarios below.</p>
<p>To minimise latency, a customer network can route user requests to the closest Office 365 service entry point, rather than connecting to Office 365 through an egress point in a central location or region.</p>
<p>The following achieves optimal Office 365 connectivity and performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local DNS resolution and Internet egress - Provision local DNS servers in each location and ensure that Office 365 connections egress to the internet as close as possible to the user's location. This configuration minimises latency and improves connectivity to the closest Office 365 entry point.</li>
<li>Add regional egress points - If the organisation network has multiple locations but only one egress point, add regional egress points to enable users to connect to the closest Office 365 entry point. This configuration minimises latency and improves connectivity to the closest Office 365 entry point.</li>
<li>Bypass proxies and inspection devices - Configure browsers to send Office 365 traffic directly to egress points and bypass proxies. Configure edge routers and firewalls to permit Office 365 traffic without inspection. This configuration minimises latency and reduces the load on network devices.</li>
<li>Enable split tunnelling connection for VPN users - If a VPN solution is required Always on VPN should be integrated into the organisation infrastructure. For VPN users, enable Office 365 connections to connect directly from the user's network rather than over the VPN tunnel by implementing split tunnelling. This configuration minimises latency and improves connectivity to the closest Office 365 entry point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimisation design considerations and decisions apply to all agencies and implementation types.</p>

<h3 id="exchange-hybrid">Exchange hybrid</h3>
<p>This section is only relevant for agencies implementing a hybrid solution that leverages an on-premises Exchange Server(s).</p>
<p>Exchange Online can be used standalone (cloud only) or integrated with an on-premises Exchange Server(s) and Active Directory Domain Services, extending the organisation's messaging farm in a hybrid configuration.</p>
<p>A Hybrid configuration provides administrators with added flexibility to transition users to the Cloud without isolating them from the on-premises resources. A Hybrid configuration can also assist with transport routing for compliance reasons (e.g. Govlink) when "centralized mail transport" is enabled. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/exchange/edge-transport-servers">Edge Transport</a> service may be deployed in scenarios where the organisation does not wish to expose Hybrid mail servers directly to Exchange Online Protection.</p>
<p>Agencies wishing to synchronise their existing on-premises Active Directory Domain Services for identity (hybrid identity) must maintain an on-premises Exchange server for recipient management purposes, this is because most of the user attributes cannot be managed from Exchange online due to directory synchronisation rules, for more information see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/exchange/decommission-on-premises-exchange">decommissioning on-premises Exchange servers</a>.</p>
<p>Establishing a hybrid deployment requires an Exchange hybrid server that is supported with your existing on-premises Exchange Server. Microsoft recommends the deployment of the newest Exchange Hybrid server for your environment to ensure the best compatibility with Exchange Online. </p>
<p>Exchange 2010 has reached <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/exchange-2010-end-of-support?view=o365-worldwide">end of support</a>, agencies that wish to use retain a Hybrid configuration after the Hybrid migration method should migrate those Exchange server roles to a supported version of Exchange. Microsoft also recommend that agencies still on Exchange 2010 that have not started or completed their Hybrid migration, upgrade from 2010 to 2016 before commencing the hybrid configuration. </p>

<h3 id="autodiscover">Autodiscover</h3>
<p>Autodiscover is a mechanism for the configuration of a user's email client with minimal user input. The required input from the user is their email address and password.</p>
<p>Autodiscover for a cloud environment varies from the process utilised when on-premises Exchange is leveraged. With a cloud environment, an Autodiscover Endpoint representing the domain is not available. Instead, DNS redirection and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) redirection is leveraged to direct the Autodiscover client to a trusted Autodiscover Endpoint. The high-level process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Autodiscover endpoint looks for a host named autodiscover.{DomainName}.com</li>
<li>DNS provides the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the host autodiscover.outlook.com</li>
<li>The Autodiscover client attempts communication utilising HTTPS (This fails)</li>
<li>The Autodiscover client requests redirection over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (This directs the client to autodiscover-s.outlook.com)</li>
<li>The Autodiscover client attempts communication utilising HTTPS. The communication is successful. However, the new Autodiscover endpoint does not have a server certificate for the requested hostname. This communication is then redirected using HTTPS redirection to an additional Autodiscover endpoint which can provide the required Autodiscover information.</li>
<li>The Autodiscover client completes the Autodiscover process with the new Autodiscover endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure this process functions as described above, appropriate DNS records are required.</p>

<h3 id="spf-dmarc-and-dkim">SPF, DMARC and DKIM</h3>
<p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are tools for email authentication. These tools can coexist to provide enhanced capabilities.</p>
<p>These tools can coexist to provide enhanced capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>SPF - SPF is a DNS entry which lists the servers which can send emails from a specific domain. It allows recipients to verify the identity of incoming mail.</li>
<li>DKIM - DKIM, unlike SPF is a tool to verify whether the content of the message is trustworthy. This is completed using a public/private key signing process.</li>
<li>DMARC - DMARC enables both SPF and DKIM using policy. A DMARC policy sets out how to handle messages which do not align to what the receiver knows about the sender. This can include rejecting the message; suggesting the message is quarantined; or allowing the message.</li>
</ul>
<p>While DKIM within Office 365 can sign messages, the organisation gateway may also be configured to do this which may cause issues with DMARC verification.</p>
<p>Note, agencies that enable DKIM signing within Office 365 that also add additional business logic to email at the egress mail gateway, such as adding a default organisation email disclaimer, would fail DKIM authentication as the contents of the email had changed after the email had been sent from Exchange Online. In this scenario consider migrating the business logic from the mail gateway to native Exchange Online transport rules.</p>

<p>The following certificates are associated with an Exchange Hybrid deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Active Directory Connect (Azure AD Connect) with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) – a third party certificate from a Trusted Authority (CA) is required to establish a trust between web clients and federations server proxies used to sign and decrypt security tokens.</li>
<li>Exchange Federation – a self-signed certificate is used to create a secure connection between the on-premises Exchange server and Azure Active Directory authentication</li>
<li>Exchange Services – a third party certificated from a Trusted Authority (CA) is required to secure the TLS communication between Exchange servers and clients. These include Outlook on the web, Exchange ActiveSync, Outlook Anywhere and secure message transport</li>
<li>Existing Exchange Servers – might use self-signed or certificates issued by a Trusted Authority (CA) depending on Exchange server certificates. These certificates may need updating for Exchange Hybrid</li>

<h2 id="exchange-online">Exchange Online</h2>
<p>Microsoft Exchange Online is a cloud-hosted messaging solution that has the capabilities of on-premises Exchange services. Exchange Online provides email, calendar, contacts, and tasks. Exchange Online supports mailbox delegation, where a delegate can have send-on-behalf and management rights over other mailboxes. Shared mailboxes can be assigned to and administered by many users. Application mail sending is supported where the application can authenticate against the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) message submission to users inside the managed environment or authenticated SMTP message relay to addresses outside the managed environment.</p>
<p>Agencies should also refer to <a href="#mail-flow-and-gateway">Mail Flow and Gateway</a> for more information on mail flows, mail gateways and the use of GovLink.</p>
<h3 id="mail-migration">Mail migration</h3>
<p>The implementation of Exchange Online can be coupled with a migration from the existing on-premises Exchange infrastructure. If a migration is not required, the deployment is referred to as a greenfield deployment of Exchange Online.</p>
<p>There are three migration options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid Migration – Often referred to as a staged migration, is where the on-premises Exchange environment is extended to Office 365 through departmental relationships or federation. During migration user mailboxes will be spread between the online and on-premises environments, this necessitates planning to ensure free/busy, calendar and mailbox sharing all continue to work.</li>
<li>Cutover Migration – A cutover migration is only recommended for organisations with less than 150 mailboxes and occurs over one or a few days. During this period email access may be unavailable. Prior to the migration event, a connection between the on-premises Exchange organisation and Exchange Online needs to be established.</li>
<li>PST Migration – A Personal Storage Table (PST) migration is where PST files with a mapping file are either shipped to or uploaded into Office 365. The Exchange Online instance is a greenfield deployment with no configuration required on the on-premises Exchange environment.</li>

<h3 id="user-mailbox-configuration">User mailbox configuration</h3>
<p>User Mailboxes are Exchange Mailboxes that are associated with a user account. Usually one mailbox is associated to one user account.</p>
<p>User mailboxes can be configured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow or disallow Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) connections to them.</li>
<li>Prevent mail from deletion.</li>
<li>Control ActiveSync connections to them.</li>
<li>Control mail size limits.</li>
<li>Control the use of mail archives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above configuration can be completed on all new mailboxes using a Client Access Services (CAS) Mailbox Plan. A CAS Mailbox Plan is used to configure settings when a licence is assigned to a new user. If the licence is changed, the CAS Mailbox plan linked to that new licence is applied. CAS Mailbox plans will be inherited from the existing organisation plans.</p>
<p>In addition to the above mailbox configuration, by default, standard user accounts have access to Exchange Online via Exchange Online PowerShell . ACSC guidance to disable unneeded features requires that this feature be disabled.</p>

<p>Authentication policies control the authentication methods which can be used to access Exchange Mailboxes.</p>
<p>Authentication policies can be leveraged to protect the organisation from brute force and password spray attacks. To protect against this, Basic Authentication can be blocked. Basic authentication is where a username and a password are leveraged for client access requests.</p>
<p>Blocking Basic Authentication forces clients to use Modern Authentication. Blocking Basic Authentication can cause issues when clients within the environment do not support Modern Authentication. If this occurs, it is recommended to investigate whether the client can be upgraded to support Modern Authentication. If it can, then it is recommended that the client be upgraded. If it cannot then a separate authentication policy can be leveraged enabling Basic Authentication for that client only.</p>

<h3 id="journaling">Journaling</h3>
<p>Journaling within Exchange is the recording of email communications as part of an organisation's retention strategy.</p>
<p>Journaling can assist with achieving compliance with government regulations. A Journal rule can be scoped to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal messages only.</li>
<li>External messages only.</li>
<li>All messages.</li>
<li>Specific recipients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Office 365 supports the use of journaling with the caveat that an Exchange Online mailbox cannot be used as a journaling mailbox. When configuring a mailbox for journaling, it must reside on an Exchange server. Journal reports can be delivered to a separate system to the Exchange Online instance. </p>
<p>Within Office 365, additional options are available to be leveraged in an organisation's retention strategy. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retention Policies.</li>
<li>Litigation hold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Retention Policies can also be leveraged across the Office 365 organisation, whereas litigation hold is configured on a per-mailbox basis. These options reduce the complexity and management overhead involved with recording email and backing up to separate systems.</p>

<p>Litigation hold preserves a mailbox and its contents from being modified or removed for e-Discovery purposes. A user can continue to send and receive email whilst litigation hold is enabled, even delete an item from the mailbox, and Office 365 will retain the items for discovery purposes.</p>
<p>Litigation hold is not enabled by default, and legal teams will need to proactively enable the feature to avoid users potentially deleting any critical data elements. You can also specify the duration for the hold, this is calculated from the date a mailbox item is received or created. If a duration is not set, items are held indefinitely or until the hold is removed.</p>
<p>Litigation hold is not an alternative to backups. While it is true that it keeps a copy of your data elements it is not saved in a separate location and cannot be restored to its original location.</p>

<p>Unlike user mailboxes, within AD, these mailboxes are represented by a disabled user account. These accounts can be enabled however this poses a security risk as the mailbox account is not related to a single user.</p>
<p>User access to the mailbox is provided using mailbox delegation rights (Full Access, Send As, Send on Behalf). These rights can be assigned either directly or using a mail enabled security group.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-lists">Distribution lists</h3>
<p>A distribution list is a grouping of mail recipients that is addressed as a single recipient. Distribution lists are used to send e-mail to groups of people without having to enter each recipient's individual address. Distributions lists can be established to receive and distribute internal, external, or internal and external email.</p>
<p>This saves the sender from needing to enter each individual email address when emailing a group. These groups/lists are generally leveraged for emailing an entire team or project. Only internal organisation employees can send emails to the "Organisation-all" distribution list.</p>
<p>Distribution lists are created in different ways depending on the Exchange architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Deployments - For cloud only deployments, distribution lists are created within Office 365.</li>
<li>Hybrid Deployments - For hybrid deployments, distribution lists can be created both within Office 365 and on-premises. On-premises lists are then synchronised to Office 365. The on-premises method has the benefit of living with the user identity source of truth however it does create complexity when it is not managed in the same location as Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hybrid distribution lists cannot be managed directly in the outlook client by the user, if this functionality is required by the organisation then it is recommended to re-create those address lists in Exchange Online.</p>
<p>Management of Distribution lists can be streamlined through the enforcement of a Naming Policy. A Distribution list Naming Policy allows the enforcement of a consistent naming strategy across Microsoft 365 groups. It consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefix-Suffix Naming Policy – Setting of prefixes or suffixes for groups names. The prefixes/suffixes can be either fixed strings or user attributes.</li>
<li>Custom Blocked Words – Blocking of words in the name based on a custom list.</li>

These apps can be purchased from <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=sharepoint">Microsoft App Store</a> and used within SharePoint Online itself.</p>
<p>SharePoint default methods of displaying and sharing of sharing data are available. Third party applications may circumvent controls or auditing and provide other methods of displaying or sharing of SharePoint data. Any third-party applications will need to be validated for compliance.</p>
<p>The blueprint requires the Office 365 tenant to be rated up to Protected. The organisation must ensure information stays within the tenant to control the follow of information between its devices and Office 365 tenancy.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-and-access-controls">Sharing and access controls</h3>
<p>Sharing and Access controls provide granular control over external sharing and access to SharePoint Online. Sharing and Access control is essential for securing SharePoint Online document and information sharing.</p>
<p>Access to SharePoint Sites can be controlled through a variety of means to ensure that the data of the sites is protected. This includes the configuration of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only allowing access from specific IP address locations.</li>
<li>Only allowing access from apps that use modern authentication.</li>
<li>Blocking access from devices which are not managed by the organisation through Microsoft Endpoint Manager.</li>
<li>Sites can be further secured through the implementation of Idle session timeouts. Idle session timeouts essentially act to log a user out of SharePoint after a period of inactivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Access Controls provides an administrative tool to restrict access contents in SharePoint.</p>

<p>This migration can take the form of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>OneDrive (SharePoint 2010/2013) – Administrators can move an existing OneDrive site hosted to SharePoint Online. Administrators can also leverage the capability of a Hybrid configuration to automatically redirect users to their OneDrive for Business post migration.</li>
<li>Network and local file shares – Most users will have a personal drive or a designated location on the network to save work which may not have a function assigned. To free up network storage and extend the ability to access files in the cloud, administrators can move files from a specific network path to the user's OneDrive for Business site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft Teams leverages most of the functionality of the Office 365 components. When a Team is created the following artefacts are created out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint Site - A new SharePoint site with the URL format of <code>/sites/&lt;SiteTitle&gt;</code>, with the <code>SiteTitle</code>'s spaces are stripped out.</li>
<li>Office 365 Group - A new Office 365 Group, which is added into the Microsoft Entra ID tenant. This is created with the site title as the Group Name.</li>
<li>Teams email – A new email address per channel can be created. The email inbox is managed centrally by the Microsoft Team services. At the time of writing this document, the email address will have a domain of <code>&lt;custom email inbox&gt;@apac.teams.ms</code>. </li>

<p>Voice calling can be configured in a number of ways depending on the requirements of the organisation, and whether a telephony system is already in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>VoIP calling: Available within Teams by default without any configuration required. Users can make voice or video calls to each other and collaborate over the internet outside of the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) system. PSTN users outside of Teams can dial in using the provided PSTN dial in conference number to VoIP meetings where this is enabled.</li>
<li>Operator Connect: Operator Connect enables a simple PSTN connection method which enables Agencies to connect to a PSTN provider of their choice if they participate in the Operator Connect program. The PSTN integration is managed as a service by the chosen operator.</li>
<li>Calling Plan via Telstra Calling for Office 365: Telstra Calling avoids the complexity of separate collaboration systems and can be enabled within Teams. Similar to Operator Connect, this method provides a fully managed service by Telstra for Teams calling to PSTN systems.</li>
<li>Direct Routing: Direct Routing enables hybrid Agencies to connect their on-premises telephony infrastructure to Microsoft Teams through a series of supported on-premises Session Border Controllers (SBC). This method provides the organisation a self-managed service for Teams calling to PSTN systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="power-platform">Power platform</h2>
<p>Power Platform combines the power of PowerApps, Power BI, and Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) into one business application platform. This enables quick and easy app building and data insights.</p>
<h3 id="power-apps-and-power-automate">Power Apps and Power Automate</h3>
<p>Power App and Power Automate are Office 365 tools to develop and create cross platform applications with minimal amount of coding. These tools enable an organisation to create forms, capture information, automate business process and present it in a report to the organisation.</p>
<p>Power Apps and Power Automate is built with an underlying connector that allows application to consume to be displayed and business process to act on this information. These connectors provide ability to consume or leverage on existing business tools. Power Apps and Power Automate connectors can be categorised as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 365 Connectors – Office 365 Connectors provides data access to Office 365 applications (e.g. SharePoint, Teams).</li>
<li>Azure Services Connectors – Azure services connector provides Power Apps and Power Automate access to consume Azure Services (e.g. Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Computer Vision).</li>
<li>Third Party Connectors – Third Party Connectors allows external vendors to provide a service to Power Apps and Power Automate (e.g. Adobe Reader Sign).</li>
<li>On-premises data connectors – On-premises data connectors allows Power Apps and Power Automate to consume data from a variety of sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following image shows consideration required for authentication process and requirements for each generalised group of connectors. The cloud services connector is required to be registered in Azure platform before it can be consumed in Power App and Power Automate. On-premises data access requires a service account for network access and a database service account access for Power Apps and Power Automate to consume its data.</p>

<h3 id="power-bi">Power BI</h3>
<p>Power BI is a data visualisation tool which can be leveraged to provide interactive dashboards and reports. It integrates with a variety of data sources to enable the creation of dashboards and reports.</p>
<p>Power BI consists of five components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power BI Desktop - Power BI desktop is a Windows desktop application which allows for the manipulation of data and the creation of reports and dashboards.</li>
<li>Power BI Service - The Power BI service is a SaaS offering which allows the creation, modification, and sharing of reports and dashboards.</li>
<li>Power BI Mobile - Power BI mobile is a mobile application which allows for the consumption of reports and dashboards.</li>
<li>Power BI Report Server - The Power BI report server is an on-premises tool which enables reports to be distributed as required.</li>
<li>Power BI Embedded – Power BI embedded allows organisation to publish Power BI report to be consumed in a public website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the Power BI Service, the creation of workspaces, content packs, custom visualisations, and data flows can be controlled both on an enterprise level and a group level. This simplifies management of the service.</p>
<p>Power BI also allows administrators to control the sharing of datasets, content, report publishing, and template apps. This ensures that the sharing of the organisation information is controlled.</p>

<h2 id="security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance</h2>
<p>Office 365 provides Security and Compliance tools which can be utilised to implement an organisation's Information Management Policy and to assist with information governance. The Office 365 Security and Compliance tools provides the ability to govern and monitor the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint Online.</li>
<li>OneDrive for Business.</li>
<li>Teams.</li>
<li>Exchange Online.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alerts">Alerts</h3>
<p>Office 365 contains various out-of-the-box Alert Policies, some of which are dependent on the available Office 365 licence. Alert Policies can be configured to track administrative activities, malware threats, user actions and/or data loss incidents.</p>
<p>Each alert can be configured with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracked Activity - The activity that will cause the alert to be generated. For example, sharing a file with an external user, assigning access permissions, or creating an anonymous link.</li>
<li>Activity Conditions - When a tracked activity triggers, additional conditions can be applied to filter out unnecessary alerts. For example, an alert can be triggered only if a certain user performs a task.</li>
<li>When to Trigger - When the above conditions are met, further filtering can be applied to only alert when a certain threshold is met. For example, an alert is only raised if the activity has been performed more than five times.</li>
<li>Alert Category - An alert category is assigned to assist with tracking and managing the alerts generated.</li>
<li>Alert Severity - An alert severity is assigned to assist with tracking and managing the alerts generated. The severity is displayed in the subject line of the alert email.</li>
<li>Alert Notification - An alert can be configured with a list of email addresses that should receive the alert notifications. Daily notification limits can also be configured to ensure an alert receiver is not bombarded with alert emails for the same event. Triggered alerts can also be viewed in the Security &amp; Compliance Center.</li>

<h3 id="classification-labels">Classification labels</h3>
<p>Classification labels which is located under the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center offers the ability to both control the data flow of sensitive information and control the retention of data. Classifications labels consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity labels – Allow label specific protection policy settings to be enforced.</li>
<li>Retention labels – Allow label specific retention policy settings to be enforced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sensitivity labels can be applied in the supported Office applications either in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, Office for the Web or using the Microsoft Information Protection unified labelling client.</p>
<p>Classification labels are published to users using Label Policies. Label Policies define the users who can utilise the label and the locations within Office 365 where it can be used. Classification labels can be applied in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually - The label is applied manually by the end-user.</li>
<li>Automatically applied based on the location of the document - Labels can be configured to automatically apply based on the location of the document. For example, SharePoint.</li>
<li>Automatically applied based on detected Sensitive Information Type - Labels can be configured to automatically apply based on the type of sensitive information found. For example, documents containing Australian drivers licence numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing, sensitivity labels cannot be configured to satisfy all of the requirements listed in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF). Some of these limitations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity labels, Exchange Transport rules or DLP, cannot set the <code>X-Protective-Marking</code> header *Origin- parameter prescribed in the PSPF.</li>
<li>When using DLP or Auto Labeling policies to set a  <code>X-Protective-Marking</code> header:</li>
<li>certain characters prescribed in the PSPF are not supported (such as <code>:</code> and <code>,</code>) </li>
<li>a character limit of 64 characters is the maximum</li>
<li>Exchange Transport rules do not have these character limitations</li>
<li>When downgrading a sensitivity label, the downgrade cannot be prevented, only forcing the user to justify the downgrade. </li>
<li>Sensitivity labels are not available within calendar invites.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following MIP methods can be used to assist with PSPF compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>For calendar invites, advise users to add the classification to the body, and use transport rules or DLP to add the required subject and header values.</li>
<li>Update the <code>X-Protective-Marking</code> header associated with the MIP label at the email gateway with the <code>ORIGIN=user@organisation.com.au</code> property. Note, internal emails inside the organisation wouldn't be tagged using this method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example email gateway rules that work with MIP are available in the <a href="../../as-built-as-configured/hybrid-network-configuration/#office-365--email-protective-markings-with-aip-technology">Network Configuration ABAC document</a>. These rules are based on regular expressions and are easily adaptable to vendor specific email gateways.</p>

<h3 id="retention-policies">Retention policies</h3>
<p>Business information is required to be managed in order to comply with industry and government regulations and internal policies that require data to be retained for a certain period.</p>
<p>Office 365 retention policies assist with meeting these requirements by providing the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure policies to proactively decide whether to retain content, delete content, or both retain and then delete the content.</li>
<li>Apply a single policy to the entire organisation or just to specific locations or users.</li>
<li>Apply a policy to all content or just content meeting certain conditions, such as content containing specific keywords or specific types of sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<p>When information is subject to a retention policy, end-users can continue to edit and work with the content as if nothing has changed because the content is retained in place, in its original location. But if someone edits or deletes content that is subject to the policy, a copy is saved to a secure location where it's retained while the policy is in effect.</p>
<p>The use of Office 365 retention policies (including litigation or preservation holds) does not replace the need for regular backups and the ability to recover that important data. Agencies should determine their own requirements for backup and recovery in accordance with their business continuity requirements.</p>

<h3 id="data-loss-prevention">Data Loss Prevention</h3>
<p>Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies enable an organisation to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365 and endpoint devices. DLP policies can be targeted to one or more products within the Office 365 suite.</p>
<p>A DLP policy can be configured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify sensitive information (Sensitive information types), documents in a specific site (for SharePoint only) or specific labels (sensitivity labels) contained in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, locally on devices (endpoint DLP) and OneDrive for Business.</li>
<li>Prevent end-users from accidentally sharing sensitive information.</li>
<li>Prevent end-users from accidentally deleting a document.</li>
<li>Update documents or emails based on sensitivity labels or data matching, used in conjunction with auto-labling feature can assist with PSPF compliance</li>
<li>Educate end-users by presenting messages them on how to stay compliant when relevant. This is done without interrupting their workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing Office 365 has over 200 prebuilt sensitive information types (Australian Passport Numbers etc.). In addition to the prebuilt sensitive information types custom types can be created. These custom types look for strings, patterns, or key words.</p>
<p>Note, endpoint DLP requires onboarding of those devices into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Agencies should consider the use of Endpoint DLP as part of a unified DLP strategy.</p>

<h2 id="exchange-online-protection">Exchange Online Protection</h2>
<p>Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is a series of filtering services within Exchange Online that protects the organisation against spam, malware, and other email threats.</p>
<h3 id="connection-filtering">Connection filtering</h3>
<p>Connection filtering within Exchange Online Protection provides Exchange Online with a list of known safe IP (IP allow list) addresses to assist with mail filtering. It can also be used to reject messages from various known malicious sources (IP block list).

<h3 id="policy-filtering">Policy filtering</h3>
<p>Policy filtering within Office 365 Exchange Online Protection refers to the enforcement of Transport Rules.</p>
<p>Transport Rules are a set of rules enforced on mail transiting through the Exchange Organisation. Transport rules can be leveraged by Administrators to complete a number of actions on all mail or a subsection of the mail transiting through the Exchange Organisation. These items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block mail with certain headers.</li>
<li>Apply disclaimers to emails.</li>
<li>Apply Office 365 message encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport Rules follow the following basic structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditions – Conditions identify which mail the transport rule applies to. These conditions largely target either information gained from message headers (e.g. the 'to', 'from' or 'CC' fields) or message properties (e.g., size, attachments, subject, body, message classification). A single rule can have multiple conditions apply.</li>
<li>Exceptions – Exceptions are an optional component of a Transport Rule and define the mail exempt from the rule.</li>
<li>Actions – Actions are used to define what actions to undertake on the messages matching the conditions and which do not match any exemption. These actions include rejecting, deleting, redirecting the emails, and adding recipients, prefixes, and disclaimers. A single rule can have multiple actions applied however some actions are incompatible with others.</li>
<li>Properties – Properties are used to define anything which do not fall into another category. This includes enforcing or testing the rule.</li>

<h2 id="microsoft-defender-for-office-365">Microsoft Defender for Office 365</h2>
<p>Microsoft Defender for Office 365 extends the native security features in Office 365. The protections provided by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 are designed to defend against attacks from multiple threat vectors including email, websites and documents stored in online libraries, such as SharePoint Online. Each of the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 capabilities is enabled and managed via policies configured from the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center.</p>
<p>Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe Links - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Links provides inspection of links included in emails and Office 365 documents to determine if it is malicious, redirecting the user if it is.</li>
<li>Safe Attachments - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Attachments provides sandbox execution of attachments to detect and delete malicious content.</li>
<li>Anti-Phishing - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Anti-Phishing provides machine learning capabilities to detect advanced phishing campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safe-links">Safe Links</h3>
<p>Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Links can help protect an organisation by providing time-of-click verification of web addresses (URLs) in email messages, Teams messages, and Office documents. Protection is defined through Safe Links policies that are configured by an organisation.</p>
<p>Administrators can redirect URLs in order to avoid being sent to the original link. In addition, administrators can obfuscate the original link preventing users from copying and pasting the link into a web browser.</p>
<p>Real-time scanning of URLs provides an additional layer of protection by scanning links during transit and hold an email message from being delivered until the links have been scanned and considered safe.</p>
<p>Safe Links can be configured at an organisation level or on a per recipient basis. These policies then be applied to either Exchange Online, Office 365 applications or both.</p>
<p>Safe Links protection works as outlined below for URLs in emails that are hosted in Office 365:</p>
<ul>
<li>All incoming email goes through Exchange Online Protection, where IP and envelope filters, signature-based malware protection, anti-spam and anti-malware filters are applied.</li>
<li>An end-user signs into Office 365 and accesses their Exchange Online mailbox.</li>
<li>An end-user opens an email message containing a URL, and then clicks on the URL in the email message.</li>
<li>The Safe Links feature immediately checks the URL before opening the website. The URL is identified as blocked, malicious, or safe.</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that is included in a custom "Do not rewrite" URLs list for a policy that applies to the user, the website opens.</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that is included in the organisation's custom blocked URLs list, a warning page opens</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that has been determined to be malicious, a warning page opens.</li>
<li>If the URL goes to a downloadable file and the Safe Links policies are configured to scan such content, the downloadable file is checked.</li>
<li>If the URL is considered safe, the end-user is taken to the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Safe Links protection works as outlined below for URLs in Office 365 ProPlus applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user opens a Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Visio, and is signed in using their Office 365 security credentials. The document contains URLs.</li>
<li>When a user clicks on a URL in the document, the link is checked by the Safe Links service.</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that is included in a custom "Do not rewrite" URLs list for a policy that applies to the user, that user is taken to the website.</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that is included in the organisation's custom blocked URLs list, the user is taken to a warning page.</li>
<li>If the URL sends an end-user to a website that has been determined to be malicious, the user is taken to a warning page.</li>
<li>If the URL goes to a downloadable file and the Safe Links policies are configured to scan such downloads, the downloadable file is checked.</li>
<li>If the URL is considered safe, the end-user is taken to the website.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anti-phishing">Anti-phishing</h3>
<p>Anti-phishing protects users by checking incoming messages for indicators that the message may be spoofed by impersonator or part of a phishing campaign. Most phishing emails involves a malicious actor disguising oneself (spoofing) as an individual who is known to the recipient. The messaged is crafted in a such a way which can trick the user into clicking a link, downloading malware, or stealing user credentials.</p>
<p>Anti-phishing uses mailbox intelligence to build a profile of communication habits between each user and maps out these relationship patterns. In an event of a phishing campaign it will analyse the message behaviour against the user profiles to determine if the sender is legitimate or an impersonator.</p>
<p>Anti-spoof specifically analyses the senders address to determine if it is legitimate or forged. Administrators can allow our block specific users from spoofing an internal domain. i.e. An external organisation to send out advertising or products on behalf of the organisation.</p>
