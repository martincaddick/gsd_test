<p>For each component within the document there is a brief description of the contents of the section, a commentary on the things that have been considered in determining the decisions and the design decisions themselves.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) Console is the preferred method to manage all settings regardless of a cloud native or hybrid implementation. Although a combination of the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) Console and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) would be able to achieve the same settings in a hybrid environment, this blueprint does not include MECM and GPOs example configurations due to the level of dissimilarities and per organisation customisation in existing MECM and GPOs configurations across Commonwealth entities.</li>
<li>Minimum version of MECM 1710 is required for co-management, recommended minimum version at is 2002 update version. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/mem/configmgr/core/servers/manage/current-branch-versions-supported">support for Configuration Manager current branch versions.</a></li>
<li>Minimum version of MECM 2211 is required for management of Windows 11 devices. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-11">support for Windows 11 in Configuration Manager.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows-hardware">Windows hardware</h2>
<p>While most modern hardware will be capable of running Windows 10, making sure the right choice of hardware is made will ensure that the Standard Operating Environment (SOE) runs efficiently. This section focuses on the technical requirements to support Windows features described in this design.</p>
<p>Windows 11 has additional hardware requirements compared with Windows 10, including a specific set of supported processors (CPUs) and increased system firmware capabilities (e.g., TPM version 2.0).</p>
<p>The style of hardware will also need to be considered, whether a typical desktop model which will be permanently located on a desk or a laptop model to facilitate a more mobile workforce. The DTA recommends that, within operational constraints, agencies consider a laptop deployment to increase the flexibility and mobility of an organisation workforce. </p>
<h3 id="hardware-requirements">Hardware requirements</h3>
<p>The hardware platform chosen to support the SOE is key to its stability and provides the components that can be configured by the operating system and applications.</p>
<p>The selected processor architecture and associated firmware capability directly influence the supportability of applications and security features of an operating system. The minimum hardware requirements listed below will ensure that the system runs reliably and is supported by the vendor, Microsoft.</p>
<p>Agencies should select a reputable hardware platform that supports enterprise features, such as having an interface to provision zero-touch UEFI configuration and updates.</p>
<p>Note: agencies that wish to implement virtual desktops or VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) should assess the chosen virtualisation or hypervisor (including cloud platforms) platform to determine the features available meet the desired security risk profile for the organisation.</p>

<p>In addition for Windows 11 SOEs, the processor must be selected from the supported list for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements">Windows Processor Requirements</a>.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-and-peripherals">Drivers and peripherals</h3>
<p>Drivers allow hardware and software to function within a SOE. Drivers are essentially written code that allows Windows to recognise physical components of a computer such as printers, keyboards, mouse, graphics cards and peripherals. It is critical these drivers are supported on the Operating System version and are deployed at the right time.</p>
<p>Drivers that are essential to the hardware platform can be deployed in the base reference image, during device deployment task sequence through MECM, via Microsoft Intune or later by Microsoft Windows Update. Drivers such as network drivers are critical during the deployment phase, whereas a microphone driver is not. The more generic a reference image, the lower the deployment and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>Other drivers like printer drivers can be deployed after the end user has logged onto the device using either a "Follow Me Print" or "Defined print queue list" selected by the end user.</p>
<p>Peripheral installation can natively be controlled through Group Policies or Intune (administrative templates or the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-deviceinstallation">Device installation CSP</a>). As device identifiers may be spoofed, a defence in depth approach should be followed using additional methods of protection such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>denying write to removable media unless the device is encrypted by BitLocker, </li>
<li>blocking of unsigned and untrusted executables, and </li>
<li>ensuring Microsoft Defender is actively scanning for threats on removable media.</li>
</ul>
<p>When restricting the installation of peripherals, there are many common human input devices (HID) (e.g. mice, keyboards etc.) where a blanket allow approach may be taken to avoid additional operational overheads, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors">System-Defined Device Setup Classes</a>. </p>
<p>Bluetooth pairing and allowed services are also controllable. The default state of Windows allows all services, thus care should be taken to define only the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-bluetooth#servicesallowedlist-usage-guide">Bluetooth services</a> required.</p>

<h3 id="firmware-configuration">Firmware configuration</h3>
<p>The firmware is the software that provides the interface between the hardware and the operating system. Firmware configuration and capabilities can directly influence the security features of an operating system.</p>
<p>Important firmware security capabilities are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>UEFI - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a replacement for the older Basic Input / Output System (BIOS) firmware interface and the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.10 specifications.</li>
<li>Secure Boot - Secure Boot ensures that the device boots using only software that is trusted by the PC manufacturer. When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software, including firmware drivers (Option ROMs) and the operating system. If the signatures are valid, the PC boots, and the firmware gives control to the operating system.</li>
<li>Trusted Boot - Trusted Boot provides an additional level of protection for the Windows kernel by verifying its digital signature. Once the signature is verified the kernel is loaded, which then in turn verifies the remaining components of the Windows startup process. These components include boot drivers, startup files, and Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM).</li>
<li>Measured Boot - Measured Boot provides a capability to detect if the firmware, bootloader, or boot drivers have been modified by comparing their hashes to those stored in the TPM. Measured Boot uses a trusted server - known as an attestation server - to determine if a client is healthy and can be permitted to access network resources or should be placed in a quarantine zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firmware that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 or newer specifications provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster boot and faster resume times.</li>
<li>Use of security features such as Secure Boot and factory encrypted drives help prevent suspicious code from running before the operating system is loaded.</li>
<li>Able to support 2 terabytes and greater hard drives with more than four partitions.</li>
<li>Some UEFI-based PCs have a Compatibility Support Module (CSM) that can emulate earlier BIOS which provide greater flexibility and compatibility for end users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Secure Boot must be disabled in order to use CSM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of Multicast deployment whereby a PC image from a PC manufacturer can be received by multiple PCs without saturating the network or source image server.</li>
<li>Support for UEFI firmware drivers, Option ROMs and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>UEFI 2.3.1 is a requirement for the use of Device Guard.</p>
<p>Secure Boot is required for the use of Credential Guard.</p>

<h3 id="trusted-platform-module">Trusted platform module</h3>
<p>A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a microchip designed to provide basic security-related functions, primarily involving encryption keys. The TPM is usually installed on the motherboard of a computer or laptop and communicates with the rest of the system using a hardware bus.</p>
<p>With a TPM, private portions of key pairs are kept separate from the memory controlled by the Operating System. Keys can be sealed to the TPM, and certain assurances about the state of a system—that define its "trustworthiness"—can be made before the keys are unsealed and released for use. Because the TPM uses its own internal firmware and logic circuits for processing instructions, it does not rely upon the Operating System and is not exposed to external software vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>A TPM of specific version number is required to support Windows features such as Windows Hello and BitLocker to help meet ACSC hardening guidelines for the OS. Windows 11 requires TPM version 2.0.</p>

<h2 id="windows-deployment-management">Windows deployment &amp; management</h2>
<p>The type of deployment and management methods used for the SOE will vary depending on the use of either a cloud native or hybrid configuration. Cloud native will typically utilise pre-installed or offline custom images with Windows Autopilot for the deployment method and utilise Intune as the ongoing management method.</p>
<p>Hybrid can benefit from enabling the MECM Co-management feature. Once enabled this allows additional deployment methods which can be utilised to ensure images remain light weight. Co-management provides a more staged approach to moving workloads into the cloud that may assist existing larger environments to complete a more gradual transition.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>Windows 10 and 11 can be deployed via Intune or MECM, or a combination of both. The configuration of a Windows deployment will depend upon which technologies are available to an organisation and whether a hybrid deployment is required.</p>
<p>Windows deployments will be based on either a deployment which is cloud native or hybrid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud native – Image on the workstation will be modified using Windows Autopilot and Intune. The OEM image in use should be from a trusted vendor or custom-built by the organisation and provided to the OEM vendor for implementation prior to being dispatched to the organisation. Alternatively, an offline image will need to be created by the organisation and applied to the workstation prior to Windows Autopilot and Intune. The offline image should be light weight consisting of the base Windows image and required base drivers only.</li>
<li>Hybrid – OEM image or MECM task sequence should be used as the base for Windows 10, with Intune and Windows Autopilot applied over the top of the image for further customisation. The OEM image in use should be from a trusted vendor or custom built by the organisation and provided to the OEM vendor for implementation prior to being dispatched to the organisation. Alternatively, an organisation specific MECM task sequence including the Windows image and base drivers. This image will then be further customised with Intune and Windows Autopilot.</li>

<h3 id="management">Management</h3>
<p>Windows 10 and 11 can be managed via Intune or MECM, or a combination of both. The configuration of Windows management will depend upon which technologies are available to an organisation and whether a hybrid deployment is required.</p>
<p>Windows management options will be based on either a deployment which is cloud native or hybrid. This section provides detailed information on the different configuration options for Windows management.</p>
<p>Cloud native deployments provides the organisation the immediate benefits of working with Intune and Windows Autopilot while also integrating directly with other cloud services including Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory (AAD). Using Intune will simplify the overall deployment and management of Windows to a single console which is also shared with the mobile device management of iOS devices.</p>
<p>A hybrid deployment gives the option of co-management which enables the organisation to manage Windows by using both MECM and Intune. Enabling co-management within MECM allows the organisation to utilise their investment in MECM and take advantage of additional cloud capabilities. This allows the organisation additional flexibility to use the technology solution that works best for them and facilitates a more gradual move to cloud native as the organisation can pilot test various workloads in Intune first.</p>
<p>Hybrid deployments can choose to enable MECM or Intune for client management depending on the cloud maturity level of the organisation or operational requirements. It is not a requirement of agencies undertaking hybrid implementations to use MECM. This blueprint provides guidance on integration between MECM and Intune for hybrid deployments however agencies with existing infrastructure may alternatively elect to migrate device management from MECM to Intune, which will not affect cyber security postures.</p>

<p>The following image displays an overview diagram of MECM Co-Management.</p>
<p><img alt="MECM Co-Management diagram" src="../../img/cd-sccm-comgmt.png#center" /></p>
<p>With co-management enabled, the organisation can choose which workloads remain on-premises and which workloads are offloaded to Intune. The workloads are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance Policies – Compliance policies define the rules and settings that a device must comply with to be considered compliant by conditional access policies. Compliance policies will also monitor and remediate compliance issues with devices. </li>
<li>Device Configuration – The device configuration workload includes settings that you manage for devices in your organization. Switching this workload also moves the Endpoint Protection and Resource Access workloads.</li>
<li>Endpoint Protection – The Endpoint Protection workload includes the Windows Defender suite of antimalware protection features including Defender Advanced Threat Protection.</li>
<li>Resource Access Policies – Resource access policies configure VPN, Wi-Fi, email, and certificate settings on devices.</li>
<li>Client Apps – Use Intune to manage client apps and PowerShell scripts on co-managed Windows devices. After transitioning this workload, any available apps deployed from Intune will be available in the Company Portal. Apps that are deployed from Configuration Manager are available in Software Centre.</li>
<li>Office Click-to-Run Apps – This workload manages Office 365 apps on co-managed devices.</li>
<li>Windows Update Policies – Windows Update for Business policies allow deferral policies for Windows feature updates or quality updates for Windows devices managed directly by Windows Update for Business.</li>
</ul>
<p>With co-management disabled and no cloud integration, the organisation will rely on on-premises management of the Windows workstations. These could include utilising MECM task sequencing, MECM Compliance and Endpoint Protection policies, various scripting methods and Group Policy Preferences. </p>
<p>There are many benefits to going cloud native or hybrid co-management utilising workloads weighted to Intune. The workstations can be managed from any internet-connected location whether that be in the office or a remote location (home, client site etc).</p>

<h2 id="windows-standard-operating-environment">Windows standard operating environment</h2>
<p>The Standard Operating Environment (SOE) consists of the customisations to Windows 10/11 that will vary between environments. The customisations are largely cosmetic and functional in nature to ensure that end users can operate efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating system</h3>
<p>The operating system allows software application to interface with the hardware. The operating system manages input and output device components like the mouse, keyboard, network and storage.</p>
<p>Windows 10 and 11 are available in several editions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home – minimal management and deployment features and cannot be joined to either an on-premises or Microsoft Entra ID domain. It is targeted from home use only</li>
<li>Professional – this edition includes management and deployment features and can be joined to both an on-premises and Microsoft Entra ID domain</li>
<li>Enterprise – this edition has additional enterprise security features as well as the UE-V and App-V clients built in and only distributable through Microsoft's Volume Licensing Program</li>
</ul>
<p>Servicing of Windows 10 and 11 falls into three distinct channels (previously known as rings):</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Insider Program – Windows Insider Program receive feature updates immediately allowing pilot machines to evaluate early builds than the General Availability channel. A business must opt-in for this service and install a specific Windows Insider Program for Business Preview build.</li>
<li>General Availability – General Availability Channel receives feature update annually and is designed for the broad population of general-purpose devices within an organisation. The General Availability Channel is the default servicing channel for all Windows 10 and 11 devices with the exception of Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) release of Windows 10/11 Enterprise.</li>
<li>Long-Term Servicing Channel – Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) receives releases much more gradually (expected every 2 - 3 years) and is designed for special purpose devices such as those used in Point of Sale (POS) systems or controlling factory or medical equipment, and those machines without Microsoft Office. Additionally, a number of applications are not supported on LTSC Windows devices, for example Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Store, and Microsoft Mail, amongst others.</li>

<p>Licence keys and activation processes are leveraged by Microsoft to ensure that the device or user is eligible to use the feature or run the product (i.e. Windows 10).</p>
<p>Windows 10/11 licensing has evolved significantly since the initial release by Microsoft. In addition to the traditional activation methods for on-premises networks (KMS, MAK and AD Based Activation) it is also possible to use Windows Subscription Activation. The evolution of Windows 10 activation is described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from Windows 10 Pro version 1703, Windows 10 Subscription Activation feature enables a step up from Windows 10 Pro edition to Windows 10 Enterprise for those with a qualifying Windows 10 or Microsoft 365 subscription.</li>
<li>Microsoft Entra ID available for identity management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Office 365 products require licensing to enable full functionality and support. The available activation methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 365 based activation - Office 365 is Microsoft's productivity solution in the cloud. Office 365 has two sets of suites: one for the small and medium business segment and one for the enterprise segment. These suites are sold across different channels and programs designed to meet each segment's needs. Products are assigned to users and then activated through the online Microsoft Office 365 licensing service.</li>

<h3 id="profiles-personalization-and-folder-redirection">Profiles, personalization, and folder redirection</h3>
<p>Profiles are a collection of data and settings for each user of a Windows computer. Examples of data captured as part of a user's profile are user settings, desktop shortcuts, and application settings.</p>
<p>Profile configuration values are specific to a single user and are stored in a single folder known as the 'User Profile'. These configuration parameters (themes, window colour, wallpapers, and application settings) determine the look and feel of the operating environment for a specific user.</p>
<p>Microsoft includes several standard options for user profiles. Alternatively, technologies such as Microsoft UE-V or FSLogix can be used to address user profile and personalisation requirements. If no user profile is configured, a desktop local profile is used, which does not backup options but performs well.</p>
<p>Microsoft provide the following profile management solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Profiles – Local user profiles are stored on the workstation. When the user logs on for the first time, a local user profile is created for the user and stored by default in <code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%</code>. Whenever a user logs on to the workstation, the user's local user profile is loaded. When the user logs off the workstation, any configuration changes made to the user's profile are saved in the user's profile</li>
<li>Mandatory Profiles – Mandatory profiles are a profile that does not save profile changes and are enforced at each logon</li>
<li>Roaming Profiles – Roaming user profiles are stored in a central location on the network, which is generally a shared folder on a server. When the user logs on to a workstation, the roaming user profile is downloaded from the network location and loaded onto the workstation. When the user logs off the workstation, any profile changes are saved to the network share. In addition to maintaining a copy of the roaming profile on the network share, Windows also keeps a locally cached copy of the roaming profile on each workstation that the user logs on. </li>
</ul>
<p>Windows 10/11 provides two main roaming profile technologies in User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) and FSLogix. FSLogix is now the preferred Roaming Profile option as it provides a consistently higher performance than UE-V and can provide a cloud-based roaming profile when configured with suitable Azure cloud storage blobs.</p>

<h3 id="windows-update-and-patching">Windows update and patching</h3>
<p>Many updates released for operating systems and application contain bug fixes and security updates. Vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious code or hackers and need to be patched as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A risk assessment of a vulnerability is essential in determining the timeframe for applying patches. There are many different sources and indicators that will help with this assessment, for example if the vendor releases a patch outside of their normal patching cycle and its marked as a critical update then it is worth immediate investigation and deployment to see how it could affect an organisation.</p>
<p>It is vital to have a robust and reliable patch management solution based on industry best practices.</p>
<p>For Microsoft Windows environments the primary patching technologies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server Update Service – WSUS enables administrators to deploy the most recent Microsoft updates. A WSUS server connects directly to Microsoft Update or an "upstream" WSUS server. This allows administrators to control what updates are applied and when, rather than having every computer on the network going to the Internet and installing every available update immediately.</li>
<li>Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) – MECM integrates with a WSUS server to deliver patch management. WSUS obtains updates from the internet and MECM is used to approve and deploy the updates. Using MECM to deploy software updates allows for more control over many aspects of the process such as targeting, maintenance windows, scheduling, and reporting.</li>
<li>Microsoft Intune – Windows Update for Business provides management policies for several types of updates to Windows devices.</li>
<li>Feature updates: feature updates contain security and quality revisions, significant feature additions and changes; they are released semi-annually in March and September.</li>
<li>Quality updates: these are traditional operating system updates, typically released the second Tuesday of each month (though they can be released at any time). These include security, critical, and driver updates. Windows Update for Business also treats non-Windows updates (such as those for Microsoft Office or Visual Studio) as quality updates. These non-Windows Updates are known as "Microsoft updates" and can configure devices to receive or not receive such updates along with their Windows updates.</li>
<li>Driver updates: these are non-Microsoft drivers that are applicable to the devices. Driver updates can be turned off by using Windows Update for Business policies.</li>
<li>Microsoft product updates: these are updates for other Microsoft products, such as Office. These updates can be enabled or disabled by using Windows Update for Business policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update rings are policies that are assigned to groups of devices. Intune can define update rings that specify how and when service updates are deployed to Windows devices. By using update rings, it is possible to create an update strategy that mirrors business needs.</p>
<p>To deploy patches to endpoints as quickly as possible, client-side settings should not restrict or delay the installation of patches where it does not interfere with critical operation or cause loss of data due to unexpected reboots.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-optimisation">Delivery optimisation</h3>
<p>Delivery optimisation makes use of configurable peer-to-peer or caching technologies to decrease the internet bandwidth consumed by patches and updates.</p>
<p>Within an organisation application deployments and patch updates can occur daily to keep an organisation secure and provide the end users the capabilities to perform their work. These application deployments and patch updates can consume high levels of bandwidth, increasing the cost to an organisation. To allow organisations to decrease bandwidth use and cost organisations can implement Delivery Optimisation solutions within their main and remote offices. Delivery Optimisation is essentially a peer-to-peer client service that allows end clients to source installation packages and updates from other clients/servers within the network as opposed to always obtaining them from the source servers or the internet. There are two types of configuration options for Delivery Optimisation:</p>
<p>The following options apply to cloud native and Hybrid (configured in Intune):</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP only, no peering: Delivery Optimisation cloud service used to provide metadata only. Content to be retrieved from the downloads original source with peer-to-peer disabled. </li>
<li>HTTP blended with peering behind same NAT: Peer-to-peer sharing within the same network. Delivery Optimisation cloud service locates peers that connect to the internet using the same public IP and attempts to connect peers using their private subnet IP. </li>
<li>HTTP blended with peering across private group: Peers are automatically grouped by using the Active Directory Domain Services site or domain they reside in. Custom groups can also be used with peers being either manually or dynamically added to the group. Peers within the same group are connected.</li>
<li>HTTP blended with internet peering: Enabled Internet peer sources for Delivery Optimisation.</li>
<li>Simple download mode with no peering: Delivery Optimisation cloud services are disabled. This mode is automatically used with the Delivery Optimisation cloud service is not accessible or when the content file size is less than 10 MB.</li>
<li>Bypass mode: Microsoft BITS will be used instead and should only be used if WSUS is in use and the preference is for BranchCache. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following options apply to Hybrid (configured in MECM):</p>
<ul>
<li>BranchCache: Allows systems within the same subnet and separated from a content source to share downloaded content locally instead of traversing a latent network link back to the MECM content source. </li>
</ul>
<p>BranchCache provides two modes of operation being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Cache Mode - Content cache at a remote office is distributed among client systems.</li>
<li>Hosted Cache Mode - Content cache at a remote office is hosted on one or more hosted cache servers.</li>
<li>Peer Cache: Is a built-in Configuration Manager solution that allows the clients to share content with other clients directly from their local cache providing Delivery Optimisation. </li>
<li>Microsoft Connected Cache: With MECM version 1910 a MECM distribution point can be configured as a Microsoft Connected Cache server allowing it to act as an on-demand cache for content downloaded by Delivery Optimisation. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="microsoft-office-edition">Microsoft Office edition</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office is available in two release cycles and within those release cycles there are multiple editions.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office has two release cycles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise – Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise combines the Microsoft Office desktop suite with cloud-based versions of Microsoft's communications and collaboration services—including Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Office Online, and Microsoft Teams. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is upgraded with new features on a regular basis via feature update channels.</li>
<li>Traditional Microsoft Office – Traditional Microsoft Office is sold as a one-time purchase and provides Office applications for a single computer. There are no upgrade channel options which means to upgrade to the next major release, another copy of MS Office will have to be procured. Traditional Microsoft Office is not upgraded with new features for the life of the release. Microsoft Office 2019 is the latest traditional version available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these release cycles, you can choose the architecture of 32-bit or 64-bit. Microsoft Office provides 32-bit or 64-bit version to be installed on Windows devices. Microsoft 64-bit version of Office will be automatically chosen to be installed, unless 32-bit version is installed. The 64-bit version of Office provides ability working with larger datasets and files. However, 64-bit version of Office does not support legacy macros, and COM Add-In.</p>
<p>Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise provides three feature update channels for customers to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Channel - new Office features are available as soon as they are released, not on a set schedule.</li>
<li>Monthly Enterprise Channel: new office features are released in a predictable monthly schedule.</li>
<li>Semi-annual Enterprise Channel: new Office features are released twice a year. </li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft Project and Visio (365 and 2019) are available as click-to-run editions that can be either licenced through Microsoft 365 or through hybrid licensing. Regardless of the licence type, they can be installed through Intune or MECM (for hybrid deployments). The installation media is configured using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49117">Office Deployment Tool (ODT)</a> which generates the installer and configuration options for the deployment. Microsoft Office 365 E3/E5 licensing does not include the rights to use these applications. There are some caveats to what combination of Office versions are supported alongside Project and Visio, please see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/deployoffice/install-different-office-visio-and-project-versions-on-the-same-computer">supported scenarios</a>.</p>

<h3 id="onedrive-for-business">OneDrive for Business</h3>
<p>OneDrive for Business provides a robust cloud storage platform for government agencies.</p>
<p>This OneDrive for Business section considers the client component only. The configuration of the server component of OneDrive for Business is contained in the Office 365 Solution Overview document.</p>
<p>OneDrive enables the secure sharing of files inside and outside an organisation, and on any compatible device. Compliance settings allow administrators to control the level of security within the application.</p>
<p>OneDrive also facilitates collaboration between users. Co-authoring is available via Office web apps, Office mobile apps, and Office desktop apps, helping users maintain a single working version of any file and edit concurrently.</p>
<p>The OneDrive for Business client has access to two distinct primary rings and an additional preview ring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Ring – The Production ring provides new features and improvements as soon as they are released by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Enterprise Ring – The enterprise ring rolls out changes after validated in the Production ring, reducing the risk of issues. This ring enables administrators to deploy updates from an internal network location and control the timing of the deployment (within a 60-day window). This is the recommended update ring for most large scale or high-risk organisations.</li>
<li>Insiders Ring – Insider ring users will receive builds that let them preview new features coming to OneDrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Windows Known Folder feature of OneDrive for Business enables administrators to easily move files in a users' Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to OneDrive.</p>
<p>OneDrive Files On-Demand enables users to view, search for, and interact with files stored in OneDrive from within File Explorer without downloading them all to the local device. The feature delivers a unified look and feel for both OneDrive and local files whilst saving on space normally taken up on the local hard drive.</p>
<p>OneDrive allows users to work on content that is stored online in the cloud as well as store and synchronise content locally through the OneDrive for Business client. Synchronising this content between the client device and OneDrive storage can consume a considerable amount of bandwidth especially if the internet connection is slow. The OneDrive for Business client provides the capability to shape upload and download rates for synchronising content hence reducing the impact on the network. If the internet connection is too slow the end user can continue to work on the content locally and the content will be automatically synchronised by OneDrive for Business client when the internet connection speed improves.</p>

<h2 id="windows-security">Windows security</h2>
<p>Security settings are applied to the SOE largely to slow down and prevent malicious adversaries and payloads from causing harm to an organisation. The security settings should not prevent legitimate users from conducting work and should provide them with the correct amount of access to the environment to allow them to operate without impeding the work.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-defender">Microsoft Defender</h3>
<p>Microsoft delivers several threat protection and mitigation capabilities in Windows Enterprise devices delivered through Microsoft Defender.</p>
<p>These capabilities do not require additional agents and are manageable via Intune Endpoint Protection Profiles.</p>
<p>The following details the Microsoft Defender capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Defender Antivirus – Provides anti-malware and spyware protection including always-on scanning, dedicated protection updates and cloud-delivered protection. Integration with Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers enable real time scanning of files as they are downloaded to detect malicious software.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard – Provides Host-based Intrusion Protection System (HIPS) capabilities and replaces the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Application Guard – Provides hardware isolation of Microsoft Edge to protect against malicious websites. Protection is provided through the use of Hyper-V enabled containers isolated from the host operating system for opening untrusted websites.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Credential Guard – Provides virtualisation-based security to isolate credentials to protect against identity theft attacks. Much like Device Guard, Credential Guard uses Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) to isolate processes, in this case the Local Security Authority (LSA). The LSA performs various security operations, including the storage and management of user and system credentials. Unauthorised access to the LSA can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Remote Credential Guard – Provides protection of credentials used over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting the Kerberos authentication request back to the device requesting the remote connection. Remote Credential Guard cannot be used when connecting to remote desktops that are are not joined to the same Active Directory Domain Services domain as the client, or where there is no trust relationship between the client device and the remote desktop.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender Firewall – Provides stateful packet inspection and blocking of network traffic. Windows Defender Firewall blocks unauthorized network traffic flowing into and out of the client endpoint reducing the attack surface of the device.</li>
<li>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen – Provides malware and phishing website protection including downloaded files. SmartScreen protects users by performing the following.</li>
<li>Analysing webpages for signs of distrustful behaviour and shows a warning page if it identifies suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Validates sites against a dynamic list of known phishing and malicious software sites and shows a warning page if it identifies page.</li>
<li>Validates downloaded files against a list of known software sites and programs and shows a warning page if it identifies the site or program may be malicious.</li>
<li>Validates downloaded files against a list of files that are known and used by a large number of windows users. If not found on the list SmartScreen shows a warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft Defender Exploit guard comprises of the below features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploit protection – Exploit protection applies exploit mitigation mechanisms to applications. Works with third-party antivirus solutions and Windows Defender Antivirus.</li>
<li>Attack surface reduction – Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules reduce the attack surface of applications with rules that stop the vectors used by Office, script, and mail-based malware.</li>
<li>Network protection – Network protection extends the malware and social engineering protection offered by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge to cover network traffic and connectivity on organisation devices.</li>
<li>Controlled Folder Access – Controlled folder access protects files in key system folders from changes made by malicious and suspicious apps.</li>

<h4 id="web-advertisement-blocking">Web advertisement blocking</h4>
<p>Web advertisements may be used by threat actors to deliver malicious code or to attempt to phish legitimate users.</p>
<p>The ACSC recommends blocking browsers from processing web advertisements as part of the Essential Eight. Microsoft Edge's native web advertisement capability is limited and does not provide an effective mitigation against the risk of malicious web advertisement. Edge supports third-party add-ons to provide greater web advertisement blocking with examples including uBlock Origin and Ad Block Plus. However, please note that the DTA does not explicitly recommend either product or other third-party add-ons. Instead, agencies should perform their own risk-based assessment prior to using them as part of a blueprint deployment.</p>
<p>If supported by their existing web content filtering implementations, agencies may also implement web advertisement blocking at the proxy level for additional protection against web advertisement-based threats.</p>

<h3 id="windows-defender-application-control">Windows Defender Application Control</h3>
<p>Application control is a crucial line of defence for protecting enterprises given today's threat landscape, and it has an inherent advantage over traditional antivirus solutions. Specifically, application control moves away from the traditional application trust model where all applications are assumed trustworthy by default to one where applications must earn trust in order to run. ASD frequently cite application control as one of the most effective means for addressing the threat of executable file-based malware (.exe, .dll, etc.).</p>
<p>Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) helps mitigate these types of security threats by restricting the applications that users can run and the code that runs in the System Core (kernel). WDAC policies also:
- Enforce Constrained Language mode for Windows PowerShell.
- Enforce the use of drivers signed by Windows Hardware Quality labs and produced by partners who have an Extended Verification certificate.
- Block unsigned and unapproved scripts, MSIs, Universal Windows Store Applications, and .NET applications.</p>
<p>To reduce management overhead, WDAC allows for the use of managed installers; such as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. When configured, items deployed via the managed installer are added into the allow list. </p>
<p>When deploying WDAC it is important that it is deployed utilising audit mode prior to enforcement. </p>

<h3 id="identity-providers">Identity providers</h3>
<p>The identity providers section considers the different methods of logging on to the Windows 10/11 device. The local administrator account is addressed in a separate section.</p>
<p>Windows 10/11 provides various user account types or identity providers. This section outlines the identity providers that can be implemented for a Windows 10/11 device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Accounts - A local account is an account on a single Windows system. Local accounts are not replicated and cannot access to corporate resources. They allow access to local storage only. It may be desirable to disable, rename and scramble the passwords for the in-built local accounts.</li>
<li>Active Directory Domain - Domain identities are used to grant access to corporate resources and are implemented using Active Directory Domain Services. Administrators manage domain identities and ensure that users have access to the appropriate resources when group policies or any profile management solution is applied to the account. Domain identities are recommended if personalisation data will be stored in a corporate datacentre and will be synchronised to multiple corporate devices.</li>
<li>Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud directory and identity management service. Microsoft Entra ID includes a full suite of identity management capabilities. Microsoft Entra ID is a prerequisite for Microsoft Intune mobile device management including Conditional Access.</li>
<li>Microsoft Account - A Microsoft Account is an email address issued by or linked to a Microsoft authentication service. A Microsoft Account is a public version of a Microsoft Entra IDy account. If this account is disabled certain features such as Windows Store cannot function.</li>

<h3 id="desktop-analytics">Desktop analytics</h3>
<p>Desktop Analytics is a service which provides insight and intelligence to an organisation to make informed decisions about the update readiness of the Windows clients. Desktop Analytics is a Microsoft cloud service that integrates with Configuration Manager (MECM). The data collected from the organisation is pooled together with many of other systems that are connected to the Microsoft cloud services.</p>
<p>Desktop Analytics can be used with Configuration Manager to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture application inventory for an organisation.</li>
<li>Analyse application compatibility with latest Windows 10/11 feature updates.</li>
<li>Determine compatibility issues and provide potential resolutions.</li>
<li>Analyse the data to provide pilot groups consisting of devices which cover most of the organisation's application set.</li>
<li>Deploy Windows 10/11 to pilot and production-managed devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop Analytics is replacing Windows Analytics and Configuration Manager (MECM) is a pre-requisite to enabling Desktop Analytics. Desktop Analytics provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device and software inventory - collect information such as application information and Windows versions.</li>
<li>Pilot identification - Identifying the devices which have the most coverage of components for the pilot of Windows upgrades and updates.</li>
<li>Issue identification - Potential issues are highlighted with upgrading and patching Windows by analysing captured data from Microsoft clients and organisational data. Potential mitigations can then be recommended.</li>
<li>Configuration Manager integration - Extends the on-premises infrastructure by allowing data to be analysed in order to assist in the deployment and management of Windows devices.</li>

<h3 id="office-macro-hardening">Office macro hardening</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office files can include Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming code (macro) embedded into the document.</p>
<p>A macro can comprise of several repeatable actions that can be coded or recorded and rerun later to automate repetitive tasks. Macros are powerful tools that can be easily created by novice users to greatly improve their productivity. However, an adversary can also create macros to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as assisting in the compromise of workstations to exfiltrate or deny access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>The ACSC provides guidelines in securing systems against malicious macros and recommend they are implemented in all Windows environments. The ACSC recommends that one of the following approaches is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>All macros are disabled.</li>
<li>Only macros from trusted locations or sandboxed environment are enabled.</li>
<li>Only macros digitally signed by trusted publishers are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where trusted locations are used, ACSC recommends that when using trusted locations, only privileged users that are responsible for validating that the macros are free from malicious code can write to and modify contents within the trusted location. </p>
<p>Microsoft Office products can log macro execution attempts (both successful and failures) by enabling the Trust Center logging feature. This provides valuable information for incident response and digital forensics activities. The Trust Center logs are not written to the Windows Event Log but instead as an individual file per Microsoft Office product to the C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\TCDiag directory.</p>

<h3 id="ole-hardening">OLE hardening</h3>
<p>Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a functionality within Microsoft Office which allows for the embedding and linking to documents and other objects. OLE is utilised to seamlessly integrate several types of data or components within a Microsoft Office file. </p>
<p>Adversaries have leveraged the OLE functionality to enable and download malicious content or execute a malicious payload. Within Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Office 2019 clients, the activation of objects that link to extensions that are considered high risk are blocked from executing. The list of high risk extensions can be configured through the use of Intune or GPOs.</p>
<p>The ACSC provides guidance around securing systems against malicious OLE packages and recommend they are implemented in all Windows environments. The guidance is to block all OLE packages from executing in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>

<h3 id="local-administrator">Local administrator</h3>
<p>The default local Administrator account is a highly privileged user account found on every Windows operating system. The Administrator account is the first account that is created during the installation for all Windows client operating systems.</p>

<p>The default Administrator account cannot be deleted or locked out, but it can be renamed and / or disabled. It is Microsoft best practice and an ACSC hardening guideline recommendation to leave the Administrator account disabled and renamed.</p>
<p>If there is a requirement to utilise the local Administrator account in an on-premises environment, Microsoft provides Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), an Active Directory integrated Access Control List (ACL) protected password management tool.</p>
<p>LAPS allows system administrators the ability to set a different, random password for the common local administrator account on each computer in the domain and store the password for the computer's local administrator account in Active Directory, secured in a confidential attribute in the computer's corresponding Active Directory object.</p>

<p>Update policies control the update frequency of managed devices. Intune can define update policies that specify how and when service updates are deployed to iOS devices. By using update rings, it is possible to create an update strategy that mirrors business needs.</p>
<p>iOS devices should be configured to adhere to the ACSC hardening requirements to provide secure access to corporate information. ACSC recommends that the latest version of iOS is used in order to have the most secure operating system present on the device.</p>

<p>Device enrolment registers the iOS devices into the corporate device management solution and ensures the device is then able to be managed by administrators.</p>
<p>Microsoft Intune provides a mechanism for enrolling devices into Microsoft Entra ID. Once registered the device is populated into Intune policy groups using dynamic membership. This ensures that the device meets the compliance policy, monitored, and secured to the Agencies security requirements. </p>
<p>Microsoft Intune provides three separate experience in enrolling the iOS devices into the Agencies Azure Active directory. The enrolment experiences are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Automated device enrollment (ADE) (formerly Device Enrolment Program (DEP)) – Device Enrolment Program is a managed device enrolment process. The devices serial number is registered with Apple Business Manager allows Intune to bypass Assisted Setup by preconfigure device settings. The user's account will be assigned to the device. The device will be marked as a Supervised device.</li>
<li>Device Enrolment Manager (DEM) – Device Enrolment Manager assigns a single Azure Active Directory account as the owner of the device. The end users cannot administer or purchase any apps on the device.</li>
<li>User Enrolment – User enrolment process requires users set up the iOS device and manually install Company Portal to register the device as Intune enrolled device. The device will be marked as a BYOD device.</li>

<p>Intune provides ability to configure iOS configuration settings for securing, configuring and applications on iOS devices. These configurations are managed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) as an Intune policy. MDM allows the organisation to deploy consistent configuration on enrolled iOS devices.</p>
<p>MDM provides the capability to configure iOS devices. These devices must be configured to meet ACSC iOS Secure Hardening guide to ensure the device can access and store the Agencies data. These configurations can be categories as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security – Ensure device has up to date and secure authentication policies and encryption devices that meets ACSC Secure iOS guide. </li>
<li>Branding – The Agencies branding for lock screen, wallpapers, and reporting if the device is lost can be configured.</li>
<li>Device features – Configures device features, for example, AirDrop and Bluetooth pairing, within iOS devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Intune together with Apple Business Manager provides the ability to restrict applications deployed to iOS devices. They improve the user experience during the onboarding process and remove the requirement for an Apple ID and the public Apple App Store. When restricting application deployments, the App Store is blocked and all application management is completed through the Intune Company Portal. All applications must be licenced within Apple Business Manager and use device based licensing. </p>

<h3 id="remote-wipe-ios-devices">Remote wipe iOS devices</h3>
<p>iOS devices can be used to access information while away from the office. The device is used to access the Agencies intranet, documents and for collaboration purpose. </p>
<p>Intune provides the ability to reset the device (factory reset) or remove managed application data from the device. The Factory reset option remotely wipes and resets the iOS device. The Intune manage application wipe does not clear the device of non-managed application data which allow for potential security issues.</p>
<p>The organisation has indicated that the device must be able to be remotely wipe in case it is lost. This is to ensure information cannot be recovered in any circumstances.</p>
<p>Remote wipe iOS devices Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.</p>
