# October 2023 update
11 Oct 2023

In the last month or so we've been bedding down our processes for managing the blueprints. 
That whole life cycle of making a change, committing, reviewing and then publishing ultimately out to a web page and documents. 
We've got some more exciting stuff in the coming months so stay tuned :-)

The first couple of changes that have gone through this process are:

1. Macro Execution Logging
2. Renaming Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID
3. Issues are now live on the blueprint repo; and
4. Some typos and formatting changes

Macro Execution Logging is enabled via Trust Center Logging and better aligns with the Essential 8 guidance from ACSC. 
In the event of an incident, you'll be able to see detailed logs.

Due to product renaming by Microsoft, we've renamed all instances of "Azure AD" to "Microsoft Entra ID". Much easier to say. 
We're aware that Microsoft is still in the process of renaming some of the products like "Azure AD Connect" so we'll pick them up when Microsoft has finished.

We're also in the process of reviewing any outstanding issues from the original DTA repo and where appropriate, adding those to our backlog.
