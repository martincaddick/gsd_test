# **Get Security Done (GSD) - Microsoft Security & M365 Defender**
Quick wins to improve Security using existing M365 E5 entitlements

!!! warning "Disclaimer (you know the drill :) )"

    -    Essentially this is "Notes from the Field" - not necessarily Best Practices
    -    Please use this information wisely, at your own risk
    -    Ideally this page will be highlighting how to get the best out of both your M365 E5 security and compliance entitlements. What is the best way to step lightly thru this and gain maximum benefit for the least effort? 
    -    While most of the focus here is more on the M365 SaaS Security platform elements, not necessarily on Sentinel or Azure, there will be plenty of crossover.

## **1.   MDI (Microsoft Defender for Identity)**

### **Ways of working**
First decision point - do you have **ANY** Domain Controllers within your environment? If so then you should install MDI **NOW** and make it the very top of your Security ToDo list.

Examples of **WHY** you do this first:

-   Small Customer in 2018, back when this was called "Azure ATP", installed only as a PoC and in under 48 hours it had identified a mis-configured Server that was exposed to the internet and was being brute-forced via RDP from Eastern Europe.
-   Larger environment 2020, client not sure but was wanting to lock down Legacy Auth, suggested that as they had E5 **strong recommendation** to deploy MDI ASAP across DC's. After getting CAB Approval to deploy, and with less than 10% coverage of DC's in just over a week it popped up with "NTDIS Exfil via SMB"
-   Security Value = **Priceless**

### **Enable Telemetry**

Start here - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/prerequisites>
1.  Capacity planning - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/capacity-planning>
2.   Download the Sizing tool - <https://github.com/microsoft/ATA-AATP-Sizing-Tool/releases>
3.   Download the Sensor - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/download-sensor>
4.   Install the Sensor on DC's - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/install-sensor>
5.   Basic Settings that you should review **NOW** - <https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWFVEX>

This will do for now, especially if you are in a crisis mode, check the console for the DC's being online - now move on to validation below.
Please follow up with all other Configuration steps as soon as practible, especially if you also have ADFS in play. 
For ADFS please also check - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/active-directory-federation-services>

![Defender for Identity (MDI) Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/architecture-topology.png)

### **Validate and Test**

Be conscious that if you are testing that MDI is working correctly that this may trigger **high impact** Alerts to your Blue Team or existing SecOps IF it's already installed and being monitored - or for that matter if another tooling is in place to monitor the same behaviour - so if doing some major testing it's worthwhile letting them know before hand? And on that, make sure you schedule some time to review afterwards about what testing/alerting was created & what was visible from a SecOps perspective? 

This would be valuable lessons on effectiveness - even more so if there is missing alerts?? :( 

-   Specific Validation information - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/configure-sensor-settings#validate-installations>
-   Make sure that Advanced Settings has Integration enabled - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/classic-integrate-mde>
-   Make doubly sure this Integration is enabled between ALL elements of MDI, MDE, MDO, MDCA and the M365 Defender Console
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/msde-enable.png)
-   Use Attack Simulations to **validate MDI is installed correctly** and Alerts are being surfaced accurately:
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbooks>
-   Use Labs for **in depth checking**: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-lab-overview>
-   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/playbook-domain-dominance>
-   Go to <https://portal.atp.azure.com> and if you see this, it's not been installed correctly
![](./images/image3.png)

### **Enable Reporting**

Once enabled you should now have a lot more visibility into the Security Posture of the onPrem environment - including the following:

-    Domain controllers with Print Spooler service available
-    Dormant entities in sensitive groups
-    Entities exposing credentials in clear text
-    Microsoft LAPS usage
-    Legacy protocols usage
-    Riskiest lateral movement paths (LMP)
-    Unmonitored domain controllers
-    Unsecure account attributes
-    Unsecure domain configurations
-    Unsecure Kerberos delegation
-    Unsecure SID History attributes
-    Weak cipher usage

More details can be found here & example below - <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment#assessment-reports>
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/media/select-assessment.png)

### **Review and Improve as needed**

-   Review Security Assessments to validate what potentially needs remediation: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/security-assessment#assessment-reports>
-   Full list of the 44 Alerts that are being checked on your behalf when fully deployed: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/alerts-overview>
-   If you do not use the default Administrator account (ideally have it disabled?) then please add it to the Honeytoken account list: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/entity-tags#honeytoken-tags>
-   Audit checking via Sentinel for MDI - <https://thalpius.com/2022/12/14/microsoft-defender-for-identity-auditing-checker-using-sentinel>

## **2.   Conditional Access**

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSu_LHXQ7ucR3-MQZM3NO-a4_WRckjsP9FcUA&usqp=CAU)

### **Ways of working**
First decision point - how are we going to do this?
Questions to help you determine this are:

1.   Is it small or a large Tenancy?
2.   Do we want to avoid CAB approval process for a PoC?
3.   Need it done right now to address a strategic problem?
4.   Do we want to go fast, or take our time?
5.   If you are a Partner or MSSP please choose the "As-Code" method

Result:

* Fast and quick - start with telemetry below and do it on the fly using Policies in Reporting Mode, iterate from there...
* Larger implmentations - please take the time to review the process below to enable via "CA-as-Code" as the ROI is well worth it - especially if doing it for more than one customer or tenant :wink:


### **Enable Telemetry**
!!! warning "**NOTE: please be aware there is no inherent "BLOCK" by default**"
    You need to make sure you are BLOCKING by default unless explicitly allowing access - walk thru the 14 default Policies to better understand this. To make sure that you are fully covered please use this¬†PowerBI based tool **<https://github.com/AzureAD/AzureADAssessment>** 
    **Confirm your maturity based on this Tool ^^^^^^**

### **Automation of "CA-as-Code"**

-   Thomas N. - <https://www.cloud-architekt.net/speaking/> The most recent deck -- 2022-06-11 Scottish Summit 2022 "Deploying and Managing Conditional Access at Scale" [Slides](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/meetups/blob/master/2022-06-10%20ScottishSummit-Deploying-and-Managing-ConditionalAccess-at-Scale.pdf)

-   Excellent article here that is really worth the time reading as this will highlight how to enable this in detail: <https://www.cloud-architekt.net/aadops-conditional-access/>

![](https://www.cloud-architekt.net/assets/images/2021-08-11-aadops-conditional-access/aadops4.png)

!!! Tip
    He also points out the others that have done great work in this space:

-   Fortigi/ConditionalAccess: (https://github.com/Fortigi/ConditionalAccess)
-   AlexFilipin/ConditionalAccess: (https://github.com/AlexFilipin/ConditionalAccess)
-   DanielChronlund/DCToolbox: Tools for Microsoft cloud fans (https://github.com/DanielChronlund/DCToolbox)

!!! Info
    One other important point -- don't get caught up trying to manage GUID's:
-   [Fortigi has published some build scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/Fortigi/ConditionalAccess)¬†to convert those GUIDs to readable display names.
-   This also covers known GUIDs such as AAD Role and Application ID to DisplayName.

## **3.   Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA), was MCAS)**

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQs2hcOLld13doGTbvIknglVMDxEoot1EJ3g&usqp=CAU)

### **Ways of working**
First decision point - Simple or Complex, i.e. do you need to be concerned about RBAC for instance becuase of the scale of the installation or the number of different parties that **may** need access to part or some parts of the console?  <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/manage-admins>


### **Enable Telemetry**

- Basic Setup --> Start here:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/general-setup>
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/get-started>
- Tell it what the Corporate IP address's are: 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/ip-tags>
- Set the IP's in bulk if needed:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/api-data-enrichment-manage-script>
-   Enable File Monitoring:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/file-filters>
- Add native App Connectors: (Atlassian, Google, Azure, AWS, Box, DocuSign, Github, Okta, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Workday, etc... )
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps>
- Best Practices:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/best-practices>
- Daily Activities:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/daily-activities-to-protect-your-cloud-environment>

The best practices discussed in the link above include:

-   Discover and assess cloud apps
-   Apply cloud governance policies
-   Limit exposure of shared data and enforce collaboration policies
-   Discover, classify, label, and protect regulated and sensitive data stored in the cloud
-   Enforce DLP and compliance policies for data stored in the cloud
-   Block and protect download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices
-   Secure collaboration with external users by enforcing real-time session controls
-   Detect cloud threats, compromised accounts, malicious insiders, and ransomware
-   Use the audit trail of activities for forensic investigations
-   Secure IaaS services and custom apps

!!! warning
    -   For best protection, we recommend selecting all Office 365 components.
    -   The Office 365 files component, requires the Office 365 activities component and Defender for Cloud Apps file monitoring (Settings > Files > Enable file monitoring).
    -   Make sure the **last** checkbox (Office 365 Files) in the image below is **"checked"** [link to more details](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/connect-office-365>) 

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/connect-o365-components.png)

### **Validate and Test**

-   Enable MDE Integration
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/mde-integration> 
-   Enable MDI Integration
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/mdi-integration>
-   Govern discovered Apps using MDE (enables blocking of unwanted Apps)
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/mde-govern>
-   Investigating via Dashboard:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/investigate>
-   Tune the system: 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/tutorial-suspicious-activity>
-   Investigate & remediate risky OAuth Apps:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/investigate-risky-oauth>

!!! note
    -   It takes up to two hours after you enable the integration for the data to show up in Defender for Cloud Apps.
    -   [List of supported Firewalls and Proxies](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/set-up-cloud-discovery#supported-firewalls-and-proxies->)
    -   Follow link above for Integration steps with ZScaler, iboss, Menlo, etc...


![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/mde-settings.png)

### **Enable Reporting**

- Investigate Apps discovered by MDE 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/mde-investigation>
- Governance for Connected Apps:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/governance-actions>
This is where this process gets really good, have a real good look at all the possibilities here to be able to be able to track what is being done with data inside the environment - don't jump in & start blocking things before you understand the full business implications. 
- Governance for discovered Apps:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/governance-discovery>
Now we can take this one step further and we can now determine which of the 26,000 SaaS Apps I want to allow or block - the only real limitation (to a certain extent) is that the user is using corporate credentials from our AAD via an endpoint enabled with MDE 

### **Review and Improve as needed**

- Add Conditional Access App Control into the mix - this is where we are starting to get more into Zero Trust - so don't jump in here first, make sure the rest of the Security settings are in place and then come back to this in a later phase
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/proxy-intro-aad>

There is a lot more to be covered, but this will do for now, if you have questions please let us know?

## **7.   Sentinel Tips from the Field**

## **Sentinel Tips from the Field**

![Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/best-practices/azure-sentinel-and-other-services.png)

!!! tip "You want SOAR?" 

    -   Most folks skip Defender in preference for Sentinel...  
    -   Start from the desired outcome and work your way back from there
    -   What is it that SecOps need? - more automation, less manual work ;-)
    -   What does that look like? Showcase an example from Contoso Hotels
    -   Enable Automated Investigation & Remediation (AIR) at MDI, MDO, MDE and M365 Defender console levels - **don't skip this!** - as this enables SOAR "at source"
    -   Now that we have the first level triage in place, let's now move on to Sentinel...

### **Ways of working**

-   Raw logs by their very nature have a significant cost related to **"data gravity"** - the more Customers move/copy the logs the more complex the environment as well as more expensive the solution becomes - the design principle that should be recommend is to adhere to the MS Best Practices as much as possible.
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/best-practices-data>
-   Should there be any business justification or requirement for "raw logs" please consider a much more efficient method is the ability to stream "advanced hunting" events
-   Please make sure that any request from SecOps for **anything** more than Alerts/Incidents (like request for raw data) is balanced against cost via Business Case Justification
-   Why ingest or duplicate massive data sets across multiple systems based on a "just in case" scenario
-   A much more efficient system would be to define the "advanced hunting" event that is being searched for and as and when matches are discovered the event is forwarded
-   This process will respect data gravity and reduce costs significantly
-   More information can be found here: [Advanced hunting event collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/microsoft-365-defender-sentinel-integration#advanced-hunting-event-collection)

#### **Reducing TTR**
-   General recommendation is for Customers to focus efforts on increasing efficiency and reducing TTR (time to remediate) via Automation & SOAR natively within Microsoft Sentinel will naturally improve C3 (SecOps) efficiency without the need for any additional tools.
    -   **More information:**

-   Focus on bringing all source logging relevant to the Users Device into the one location where it can be corelated quickly and seamlessly into a SOAR process to reduce friction and improve TTR times for SecOps

### **Review and Improve as needed**

#### **Filtering Logs** 

   Can be used to reduce data noise, reduce ingestion and retention/storage costs with the goal being to focus on the logs and events that are relevant - This is typically performed by one of the methods for the following scenarios:

   -   Server Log Ingestion - Azure Monitor Agent Directly can filter out logs that are not relevant for Microsoft Sentinel 
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/best-practices-data#filter-your-logs-before-ingestion>

   -    Syslog and CEF Ingestion -- Using a log forwarder such as Logstash can parse the logs based on Customers defined rules
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/best-practices-data#filter-your-logs-before-ingestion>

   -    Custom REST API Ingestion -- Via the Function or Logic App, data can be stripped away prior to sending to Microsoft sentinel - please see following two links
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/data-transformation>
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/configure-data-transformation>


### **Cost Optimization**
-   Who knew? right ;) everyone  who has installed this finds it's too expensive?
-   It's actually not - **IF** you're diligent and methodical about how you care and look after your Sentinel deployment **AFTER** it's deployed
-   Almost like any piece of software - it needs to have an SDLC approach - once deployed (and indeed, every time you add another Data Connector) set a calendar reminder to go back and review costs/storage/trends a month later - exactly 
-   Here's some other tips...

-   Free data sources
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing?tabs=free-data-meters#free-data-sources>
-   View costs by using cost analysis
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-monitor-costs#view-costs-by-using-cost-analysis>
-   Run KQL queries to understand your data ingestion
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-monitor-costs#run-queries-to-understand-your-data-ingestion>
-   Deploy a workbook to visualize data ingestion
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-monitor-costs#deploy-a-workbook-to-visualize-data-ingestion>
-   Separate non-security data in a different workspace
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-reduce-costs#separate-non-security-data-in-a-different-workspace>
-   Optimize Log Analytics costs with dedicated clusters
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-reduce-costs#optimize-log-analytics-costs-with-dedicated-clusters>
-   Filter your logs before ingestion

This recent addition below looks adventerous - but you might at least want to review the logic and have an alert sent to the team when you should be **prompted** to review or change the pricing tier? Don't forget to make sure the LAW is changed as well at the same time :)

-   Automatically auto-scale your Sentinel pricing tiers:

## **8.   Microsoft Information Protection (MIP/AIP)**

This page will also cover Data Loss Prevention (DLP), but we'll probably build out a whole new section on Purview as this site matures, thank you for your patience - please feel free to provide feedback via raising an issue in Github.

First up - to a certain degree, you will find a lot of what you need here in the OSS page for **"Purview Customer Experience Engineering"** page - please start here: [Microsoft Purview One-Stop-Shop (OSS)](<https://microsoft.github.io/ComplianceCxE/>) **<-- Start Here**

This site is very comprehensive, and should have most answers, and will add more later - but for now it saves reinventing the wheel
