It is designed to also be used for staged deployments that leverage hybrid configurations as a transition step to cloud native transformation.\n\nEach section of the document provides a description of the relevant technology component, including considerations, decisions and their applicability to cloud native implementations, hybrid configurations, or both.\n\nIt is important to consider that even if a product is licenced for use by Microsoft, it may not be included in this blueprint if it is not required for all organisations or a product that cannot operate at PROTECTED. Additionally, an organisation may have requirements that will need to be considered outside of this blueprint.\n\nThis document covers the following topics.\n\n| Section                           | Description                                                  |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Identity and Access Management    | The Identity and Access Management section includes the authentication, authorisation methods and Conditional Access policies used within the blueprint for Cloud and Hybrid solutions. |\n| Security                          | The Security section details several cloud-based security components available within the Microsoft 365 suite to detect and monitor suspicious behaviour for Cloud and Hybrid solutions. |\n| Client Configuration              | The Client Configuration section details the Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Intune (Intune) management methods and design decisions for the client configuration. |\n| Backup and Operational Management | The Backup and Operation Management section details the backup design decisions including RPO (recovery point objective), RTO (recovery time objective) and Data Availability. |\n| System Administration             | The System Administration section details how the solution will be managed, the administrative consoles that will be used to administrator the various components, and how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to control access. |\n\nFor each component within the document there is a brief description of the contents of the section, a commentary on the things that have been considered in determining the decisions and the design decisions themselves.\n",
